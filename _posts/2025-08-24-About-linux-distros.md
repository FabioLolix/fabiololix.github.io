Personal though on licensing and development

# Post

I find it silly to give a single license to a whole ISO and inherently incorrect as the hundreds of thousand packages that are included have different licenses to the one chosen, also I don't consider as open source Linux distributions created with remixing or remastering tools regardless of which license it has been attached, such tools are handy but aren't viable as long term solution as:

* you don't know what changes have been made
* you can't build the ISO yourself
* you can't help the development
* once the maintainer stops to publish the ISO the project is dead
